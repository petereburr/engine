### [[Opening Frame]] — Defaults as Invisible Worldbuilding

- Start with a small, personal moment: opening Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Unity, etc., and noticing how the _default blue gradient_, or _Bezier curve handles_, or _Unity skybox_ sets the tone before you even make a choice.
    
- These defaults are fingerprints — they tell you what the tool “wants” you to make.
    
- We rarely name it, but software has **aesthetic gravity.**

### Section 1 — **Cliché as Tool-Print**

- Go back to the root of “cliché”: originally a term in printing for the _stereotype plate_ used to reproduce type/images. It literally meant **mechanical reproduction of sameness.**
    
- In software, cliché isn’t just a linguistic or narrative shortcut — it’s baked into presets, templates, and UI conventions.
    
- Every gradient, default font, or “new composition” setting is a quiet cliché, ready to proliferate.

### Section 2 — **Stereotype, Preset, Platform**

- “Stereotype” too comes from print — a plate used to stamp repeated impressions. The metaphor has drifted to mean social flattening, but its origin is _technical_.
    
- Software art inherits that logic: presets are stereotypes, encoded into the bones of tools.
    
- Example: After Effects’ “Lens Flare” — an effect so overused it became a visual joke, precisely because it carried the fingerprint of the tool, not the artist.
    
- Platforms accelerate this: TikTok templates, Instagram filters, generative AI prompt structures — all are stereotypes masquerading as personal expression.

### Section 3 — **The Thumbprint of the Tool**

- Each tool leaves its mark. Think:
    
    - Photoshop’s airbrush sheen of the late ’90s.
        
    - Final Cut’s default transitions in early YouTube.
        
    - Unity’s smooth plastic shaders and endlessly repeating asset packs.
        
    - MidJourney’s haunted “concept art” blur.
        
- The thumbprint is the tension: art made _with_ tools is always haunted by art made _for_ tools.
    
- McLuhan could be invoked here: “the medium is the message” → but in software, the **default is the message.**

### Section 4 — **Breaking the Default**

- The task of software art might not be _to escape_ the thumbprint but to **bend it until it squeals.**
    
- Artists who deliberately exploit or exaggerate defaults: Paper Rad with MS Paint aesthetics, JODI with browser-break art, Petra Cortright with stock effects in YouTube vids, Cory Arcangel hacking Super Mario.
    
- They don’t hide the cliché — they **make it visible**.
    
- The cliché becomes a raw material, not a trap.

### Closing Reflection — **Living With Cliché**

- The paradox: cliché/stereotype is both a constraint _and_ the only common ground from which collective imagination emerges.
    
- To work with software is to wrestle with its defaults — the traps that offer efficiency, fluency, sameness.
    
- Maybe the job of the artist isn’t to pretend tools are neutral, but to live in the cliché long enough to find the weird underside — the places where repetition frays and new worlds slip through.
